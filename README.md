# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
This small project is an introduction to HTML and CSS capabilities. It takes the form of a small photography gallery. Index.html is the homepage. Each other html file (paris.html, rome.html...) represents a gallery. Each html file contains a link to all other pages. For now, each gallery is only made of one picture (as Javascript is not yet in the scope of the project).
